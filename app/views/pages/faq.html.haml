  %h2 Frequently Asked Questions

  %h3 Why isn't Doge commenting on my merge request?
  %ul.debug-hound-not-working
    %li.debug-steps
      Note that Doge only comments when he finds a style violation. Ensure
      that changes made in your merge request actually contain style guide
      violations.
    %li.debug-steps
      Alternatively, tools like RuboCop and JSHint can be used to
      check for style guide violations locally, given your configuration.
    %li.debug-steps
      Ensure that configuration is setup to report on the specific violations.
      See the
      = link_to('configuration', configuration_path)
      page for more info.
    %li.debug-steps
      Be sure your PR is of a manageable size. The Github API has access
      limits which can affect the number of violations reported. Anecdotally,
      we've seen merge requests with more than 250 changed files get incomplete
      responses.

  %h3 Why doesn't Doge list a repo on which I'm a member?
  %p
    Only Gitlab repository managers can enable Doge for style guide reviews.

  %h3 How secure is my code now that Doge has access?
  %p
    Please see our
    = link_to('security page.',
      "#{ENV['SOURCE_URL']}/blob/master/doc/SECURITY.md")

  %h3 Do you offer a trial subscription?
  %p
    We currently don't have a trial subscription level. We suggest trying it
    out on open-sourced repos first, since these can be enabled free of charge.


  %h3 Can I have Doge check my entire repository for style?
  %p
    No, and we don't recommend doing so. It is an easy trap to fall into if
    you begin correcting styles on an entire project all at once. Doge
    allows you to focus on the code which is being modified, and enforcing good
    practices going forward.
  %p
    It can be dangerous to re-write a lot of code for just style reasons. It
    can introduce functional regressions, which are a higher-level concern than
    style.
  %p
    We believe the right approach is to convert a codebase over time, one merge
    request at a time, to conform to a style guide. Only focus on style in
    diffs and make smaller changes that ideally have tests associated with
    them.
  %p
    If you'd still like to analyze your whole repo, try using the Rubocop gem
    locally.

  %h3 How do I unsubscribe from Doge?
  %p
    If you no longer wish for Doge to lint your repo, you can cancel your
    subscription by disabling your repo on
    = link_to('the repo page.', repos_path)
